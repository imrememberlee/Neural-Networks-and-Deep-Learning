There's been a lot of type about neural networks.

00:00:06,532 --> 00:00:10,852
And perhaps some of that type is justified, given how well they're working.
考虑到它们的使用效果 有些使用起来恰到好处 


3
00:00:10,852 --> 00:00:11,902
But it turns out that so

00:00:11,902 --> 00:00:16,392
far, almost all the economic value created by neural networks has been through

5
00:00:16,392 --> 00:00:19,652
one type of machine learning, called supervised learning.

6
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:22,859
Let's see what that means, and let's go over some examples.
让我们举例看看 那是什么意思

7
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:25,888
In supervised learning, you have some input x, and
在监督学习中 你有一些输入x

8
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:30,068
you want to learn a function mapping to some output y.
以及你想学习到一个函数 来映射到一些输出y

9
00:00:30,068 --> 00:00:34,748
So for example, just now we saw the housing price prediction application where
比如 我们之前提到的房价预测的例子

10
00:00:34,748 --> 00:00:40,708
you input some features of a home and try to output or estimate the price y.

16
00:01:02,628 --> 00:01:06,878
of showing you, and some information about the user, neural networks have
因为也输入了用户的信息 于是它会考虑是否向你展示  

17
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:10,558
gotten very good at predicting whether or not you click on an ad.
神经网络已经非常擅长于预测 你是否会点开这个广告

18
00:01:10,558 --> 00:01:11,628

00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:20,688
an incredibly lucrative application of neural networks at multiple companies.
这就是神经网络在很多家公司 难以置信地提高获利的一种应用

21
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:23,898
Because the ability to show you ads that you're more likely to

22
00:01:23,898 --> 00:01:26,548
click on has a direct impact on the bottom

23
00:01:26,548 --> 00:01:29,067
line of some of the very large online advertising companies.

25
00:01:35,008 --> 00:01:36,908
mostly due to deep learning.
这也多亏了深度学习

26
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:40,998
So you might input an image and want to output an index,
你可以输入一个图像 然后想输出一个索引

27
00:01:40,998 --> 00:01:45,153
say from 1 to 1,000 trying to tell you if this picture,
范围从1到1000 来试着告诉你这张照片

28
00:01:45,153 --> 00:01:47,163
it might be any one of, say a 1000 different images.
它可能是 比方说1000个不同的图像中的任何一个 

29
00:01:47,163 --> 00:01:50,363
So, you might use that for photo tagging.
所以 你可能会选择用它来给照片打标签

30
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:54,383
I think the recent progress in speech recognition has also been very exciting,
深度学习最近在语音识别方面的进步也是非常令人兴奋的

31
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:57,773
where you can now input an audio clip to a neural network, and
你现在可以将音频片段输入神经网络

32
00:01:57,773 --> 00:02:00,788
have it output a text transcript.
然后让它输出文本记录

33
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:05,258
Machine translation has also made huge
strides thanks to deep learning where now

34
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:09,258
you can have a neural network input an
English sentence and directly output say,

And in autonomous driving, you might input
an image, say a picture of what's in
在自动驾驶技术中 你可以输入一幅图像 

37
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:20,458
front of your car as well as some
information from a radar, and
就好像一个信息雷达展示汽车前方有什么

38
00:02:20,458 --> 00:02:24,938
based on that, maybe a neural network
can be trained to tell you the position
据此你可以训练一个神经网络来

39
00:02:24,938 --> 00:02:25,958
of the other cars on the road.
告诉汽车在马路上面具体的位置

40
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:30,728
So this becomes a key component in autonomous driving systems.
这就是在自动驾驶系统中的一个关键成分

41
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:35,588
So a lot of the value creation through
neural networks has been through cleverly

42
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,218
selecting what should be x and what should be y for

46
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:54,823
different applications.
也是可以有效应用到不同的领域的

47
00:02:54,823 --> 00:02:59,963
For example, in the real estate application that we saw in the previous

48
00:02:59,963 --> 00:03:04,383
video, we use a universally standard neural network architecture, right?
我们不就使用了一个普遍标准的神经网络架构吗？

49
00:03:04,383 --> 00:03:08,373
Maybe for real estate and online advertising might be a relatively

50
00:03:08,373 --> 00:03:11,483
standard neural network, like the one that we saw.
标准一些的神经网络 正如我们之前见到的

51
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:18,978
For image applications we'll often use convolution on neural networks,

52
00:03:18,978 --> 00:03:20,538
often abbreviated CNN.

53
00:03:21,588 --> 00:03:23,858
And for sequence data.
对于序列数据

54
00:03:23,858 --> 00:03:27,698
So for example, audio has a temporal component, right?

55
00:03:27,698 --> 00:03:32,848
Audio is played out over time, so audio is most naturally represented
随着时间的推移 音频被播放出来 所以音频是最自然的表现

56
00:03:32,848 --> 00:03:37,968
as a one-dimensional time series or
as a one-dimensional temporal sequence.
作为一维时间序列（两种英文说法）

57
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:42,278

58
00:03:42,278 --> 00:03:45,668
a recurrent neural network.
一种递归神经网络

59
00:03:45,668 --> 00:03:50,128

alphabets or the words come one at a time.
语言 英语和汉语 字母表或单词 都是逐个出现的

60
00:03:50,128 --> 00:03:54,683
So language is also most naturally represented as sequence data.
所以语言也是最自然的序列数据

61
00:03:54,683 --> 00:04:00,558
And so more complex versions of RNNs are often used for these applications.
因此更复杂的RNNs版本经常用于这些应用

62
00:04:00,558 --> 00:04:04,218
And then, for more complex applications, like autonomous driving, where you have
对于更复杂的应用 比如自动驾驶 你有

63
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:09,059
an image, that might suggest more of a CNN
convolution neural network structure and
一张图片 可能会显示更多的CNN卷积神经网络结构

64
00:04:09,059 --> 00:04:12,338
radar info which is something quite different.

65
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:15,220
You might end up with a more custom, or

66
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:19,738
some more complex, hybrid neural network architecture.

68
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,808
RNN architectures.

69
00:04:27,808 --> 00:04:32,648
So in the literature you might have seen pictures like this.

70
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,600
So that's a standard neural net.

00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,658
You might have seen  pictures like this.
你可能见过这样的图片

75
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:53,958
And you might also have seen pictures like this.

76
00:04:53,958 --> 00:04:57,448
And you'll learn how to implement this in a later course.

77
00:04:57,448 --> 00:05:00,038
Recurrent neural networks are very good for

84
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,998
the column that tells you the size and the number of bedrooms.
有专门的几列数据 告诉你卧室的大小和数量

85
00:05:27,998 --> 00:05:33,318
So, this is structured data, or in predicting whether or not a user will
这就是结构化数据 或预测用户是否会

86
00:05:33,318 --> 00:05:37,190
click on an ad, you might have information
about the user, such as the age,
点击广告 你可能会得到关于用户的信息 比如年龄

labels why that you're trying to predict.
以及关于广告的一些信息 然后对你的预测分类标注

88
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:46,328
So that's structured data, meaning that each of the features,

89
00:05:46,328 --> 00:05:49,598
such as size of the house, the number of bedrooms, or

91
00:05:54,388 --> 00:06:00,378
In contrast, unstructured data refers
to things like audio, raw audio,
相反 非结构化数据是指 比如音频 原始音频

00:06:00,378 --> 00:06:05,653
or images where you might want to
recognize what's in the image or text.

00:06:28,248 --> 00:06:31,618
people are just really good at interpreting unstructured data.
